* normalizing machines...
  * removing unusable or redundant buttons
  * order joltages
  * update buttons to reflect new joltage order
  * optional: can we detect if two joltages are always in the same buttons?
    * if the joltages are the same, merge the joltages
    * if the joltages are different, there's no answer, return nil
* Find GCD in joltages. If > 1, multiply multiplier by that GCD and divide all
  joltages by that GCD.
* if caching normalized machines, start with machine with best worst-case-scenario
