* normalizing machines...
  * remove all zero values from joltages
  * order joltages
    * update buttons to reflect new joltage order
  * removing unusable or redundant buttons
  * optional: can we detect if two joltages are always in the same buttons?
    * if the joltages are the same, merge the joltages
    * if the joltages are different, there's no answer, return nil
* Find GCD in joltages. If > 1, multiply multiplier by that GCD and divide all
  joltages by that GCD.
* if caching normalized machines, start with machine with best worst-case-scenario


note: no solution if button joltage index count of the only button is not the same as joltages index count
      and if they do match, no solution if all joltage values are not the same

NOTE!: instead of driving smallest joltage to 0, drive any odd joltage to an even joltage??

always choose path with fewest odd joltages with hopes of a 2x multiplier to cut problem in half
