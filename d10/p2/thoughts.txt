* normalizing machines...
  * removing redundant buttons
  * optional: can we detect if two joltages are always in the same buttons?
    * if the joltages are the same, merge the joltages
    * if the joltages are different, there's no answer, return nil



note: no solution if button joltage index count of the only button is not the same as joltages index count
      and if they do match, no solution if all joltage values are not the same

NOTE!: instead of driving smallest joltage to 0, drive any odd joltage to an even joltage??

maybe always choose path with fewest odd joltages with hopes of a 2x multiplier to cut problem in half?
